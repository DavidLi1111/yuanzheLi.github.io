**SimLOB** introduces a representation-learning framework for modeling the dynamics of the *Limit Order Book (LOB)* in electronic financial markets.  
The method learns rich latent structures of order flow and liquidity dynamics, enabling more realistic and data-driven market simulation.

Compared to traditional handcrafted features, SimLOB captures short-term price movements and microstructure patterns more effectively, and achieves strong performance across multiple forecasting and simulation benchmarks.  
This work highlights the value of deep representation learning in high-frequency market modeling and provides a foundation for future LOB-driven simulation research.
