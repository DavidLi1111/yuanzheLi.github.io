High-frequency financial markets generate vast amounts of limit order book (LOB) data, yet traditional handcrafted representations often fail to capture the complex microstructure dynamics embedded within order flow. **SimLOB** introduces a deep representation-learning framework that models LOB dynamics in a fully data-driven manner. By learning latent structures of liquidity, order flow patterns, and short-term price movements, the method enables more realistic market simulation and prediction.

Compared to classical LOB features, SimLOB achieves substantially stronger performance across forecasting and market simulation benchmarks. The proposed approach demonstrates the value of deep learning in understanding market microstructure and provides a flexible foundation for future LOB-driven market simulation research.
